# Scripts
- As I have started working in IT I realized that there is a good idea to create some well defined scripts.
- My hope is to advance my own understanding of Powershell and general computer automation by creating this script library
- I will be putting all types of scripts, from simple Powershell scripts that manage application updates to Automated Security Scanners.
- Also note that most of these scripts will be in PowerShell since I mostly work with Windows Machines. But I will be adding some Bash scripts as well.

## List of Scripts and Summary:
- AppUpdateCheck.ps1
  - Script used for checking if there are updates needed for local applications on a Windows Machine
- IP_BackgroundCheck.ps1
  - Security focused script for finding background info on a IP address while Threat Hunting
- Windows11Migration.ps1
  - Working on using a script to do Windows 11 Migrations faster at scale. (**IN PROGRESS**)
- SimpleNPS.ps1
  - A simple Port Scanning script. Good to work in parallel with IP_BackgroundCheck for threat hunting
