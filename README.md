# Scripts
- As I have started working in IT I realized that there is a good idea to create some well defined scripts.
- My hope is to advance my own understanding of Powershell and general computer automation by creating this script library
- I will be putting all types of scripts, from simple Powershell scripts that manage application updates to Automated Security Scanners

## List of Scripts and Summary:
- AppUpdateCheck.ps1
  - User-friendly script for checking updates on Windows Machine for Applications.
- IP_BackgroundCheck.ps1
  - Security focused script for finding background info on a IP address while Threat Hunting
